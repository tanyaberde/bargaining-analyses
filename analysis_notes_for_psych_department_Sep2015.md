# Notes for Psych Department
Edelyn Verona and Toru Shimizu are considering raise for GAs but do not know variation across departments.   
**Purpose** of this analysis is to inform them.  
**Requested by**: Lex Hindash  
Data from Spring 2015 semester. Data analysed on Sep 19th, 2015

# Across Departments
Across PhD students only, quick dirty statistics say:

- Minimum: 4082
- Q1: 7890
- Median: 15120
- Mean: 13380
- Q3: 16810
- Maximum: 35220

I plotted a histogram so you have an idea of the distribution. Of course the really highly paid ones are few (like 1-2 people). These were quick and dirty stats based on last semester's data so I delve deeper in the next section.

# Per Department
Out of the huge Spring 2015 dataset, I got only the students who were at PhD level belonging to departments with more than 3 appointments. 3 is arbitrary here to get rid of outliers. I found 50 departments who fit my criteria. Then I summarized the statistics by FTE for each of those departments. I computed statistics like the mean income, median income, max and min, for each department and chopped it up by FTE. Those are in the .csv file I attached here. 

I've also got boxplots paneled by department to give you an idea of which department might be 'similar' to Psych in terms of income distribution across FTE appointments.

I also made an equivalent histogram ("histo.png" attached, not visible) if boxplots hurt your eyes.

Looks like Chemistry, Physics, School of Geosciences, and Computer Science and Engineering are the ones who resemble us in terms of how many are at 0.5 FTEs. Makes a good argument for paying Psych as well as the physical sciences, if our department can make a case for the amount of funding we bring to USF.

I also graphed median incomes for each department and FTE. Those medians are straight outta the csv spreadsheet.
